As a fitness user I would like to have an application which can help me calculate and provide nutritional information about food intake which can assist in meal planning.

## Installation Instructions

You will need node.js installed 
* [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
* Use the[MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.
* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the 
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
* After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.
* Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
